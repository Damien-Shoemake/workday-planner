- Use Moment.js library to work with date and time. 
<br>

## What the Application Does
<br>

- The application displays the current date and time at the top
- Depending on the time of the day, the application also displays color coded time blocks. 
- Future time blocks are green, current hour time block is red, and past hour time blocks are gray. 
- The workday planner has text areas that can be modified, and when pressing the "lock" icon will save the input text into local storage. 
- The workday planner will notify the user that their information has been saved into local storage. 
- The workday planner will then erase the announcement after a 4 second delay, so the user can be sure their other inputs have been saved as well. 
- The workday planner will have the information persist even after the browser has closed, given that the user has not erased their local storage.
